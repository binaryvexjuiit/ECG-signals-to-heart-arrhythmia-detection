# Heart-Arrhythmias
## Heart Arrhythmias Detection with Convolutional Neural Network

Machine learning method based on an optimal structure of CNN with max pooling, dropout .
Methodology based on the analysis of long duration (10-s) signals of ECG that contain many heart evolutions; 
Recognition of normal ,abnormal , non beat classes for cardiac arrhythmia Comparison between different neural network architecture
